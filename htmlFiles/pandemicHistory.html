          An outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area and affects an exceptionally high proportion
          of the population is known as Pandemic.
          <br>
          Disease and illnesses have plagued humanity since the earliest days, our mortal flaw.However, it was not
          until the marked shift to agrarian communities that the scale and spread of these diseases increased
          dramatically.Widespread trade created new opportunities for human and animal interactions that sped up such
          epidemics.
          Malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, influenza, smallpox, and others first appeared during these early years.
          The more civilized humans became – with larger cities, more exotic trade routes, and increased contact with
          different populations of people, animals, and ecosystems – the more likely pandemics would occur.
          Here are some of the major pandemics that have occurred over time:
        </p>

        <h2>1918 Spanish Flu</h2>
        Death Toll: 20 -50 million<br>
        Type / Pre-human host: H1N1 virus / Pigs<br>

        <p>
          Between 1918 and 1920 a disturbingly deadly outbreak of influenza tore across the globe, infecting over a
          third
          of the world’s population and ending the lives of 20 – 50 million people.
          Of the 500 million people infected in the 1918 pandemic, the mortality rate was estimated at 10% to 20%, with
          up
          to 25 million deaths in the first 25 weeks alone.
          What separated the 1918 flu pandemic from other influenza outbreaks was the victims; where influenza had
          always
          previously only killed juveniles and the elderly or already weakened patients,
          it had begun striking down hardy and completely healthy young adults, while leaving children and those with
          weaker immune systems still alive.
        </p>

        <h2>1957-1958 Pandemic</h2>
        Death Toll: 2 million<br>
        Type / Pre-human host: H2N2 virus <br>
        <p>
          In February 1957, a new influenza A (H2N2) virus emerged in East Asia, triggering a pandemic (“Asian Flu”).
          Asian Flu was a pandemic that originated in China in 1956 and lasted until 1958. In its two-year spree, Asian
          Flu traveled from the Chinese province of Guizhou to Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United States. 
        </p>
        <h2>1968 Pandemic</h2>
        Death Toll: 1 million <br>
        Type / Pre-human host: H3N2 virus <br>
        <p>
          A category 2 Flu pandemic sometimes referred to as “the Hong Kong Flu,” the 1968 flu pandemic was caused by
          the H3N2 strain of the Influenza A virus, a genetic offshoot of the H2N2 subtype. From the first reported case
          on
          July 13, 1968 in Hong Kong, it took only 17 days before outbreaks of the virus were reported in Singapore and
          Vietnam, and within three months had spread to The Philippines, India, Australia, Europe, and the United
          States. 
        </p>
        <h2>HIV/AIDS Pandemic (1981-present)</h2>
        Death Toll: 36 million <br>
        Type / Pre-human host: Virus / Chimpanzees <br>
        <p>
          First identified in Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976, HIV/AIDS has truly proven itself as a global
          pandemic, killing more than 36 million people since 1981. Currently there are between 31 and 35 million people
          living with HIV, the vast majority of those are in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 5% of the population is infected,
          roughly 21 million people. As awareness has grown, new treatments have been developed that make HIV far more
          manageable, and many of those infected go on to lead productive lives. Between 2005 and 2012 the annual global
          deaths from HIV/AIDS dropped from 2.2 million to 1.6 million.
        </p>

        <h2>SARS (2003)</h2>
        Death Toll: 770 <br>
        Type / Pre-human host: Coronavirus / Bats, Civets <br>
        <p>
          First identified in 2003 after several months of cases, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is believed to have
          possibly started with bats, spread to cats and then to humans in China, followed by 26 other countries,
          infecting 8,096 people, with 774 deaths.
          SARS is characterized by respiratory problems, dry cough, fever and head and body aches and is spread through
          respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes.
          Quarantine efforts proved effective and by July, the virus was contained and hasn’t reappeared since. China
          was
          criticized for trying to suppress information about the virus at the beginning of the outbreak.
        </p>



        <h2>H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic(2009-2010)</h2>
        Death Toll: 284,000<br>
        Type / Pre-human host: H1N1 virus / Pigs <br>
        <p>
          The 2009 swine flu pandemic was caused by a new strain of H1N1 that originated in Mexico in the spring of 2009
          before spreading to the rest of the world. In one year, the virus infected as many as 1.4 billion people
          across
          the globe and killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people, according to the CDC. <br>
          The 2009 flu pandemic primarily affected children and young adults, and 80% of the deaths were in people
          younger
          than 65, the CDC reported. That was unusual, considering that most strains of flu viruses, including those
          that
          cause seasonal flu, cause the highest percentage of deaths in people ages 65 and older. But in the case of the
          swine flu, older people seemed to have already built up enough immunity to the group of viruses that H1N1
          belongs to, so weren't affected as much. A vaccine for the H1N1 virus that caused the swine flu is now
          included in the
          annual flu vaccine. 
        </p>
        <h2>Ebola epidemic(2014-2016)</h2>
        Death Toll: 11,323 <br>
        Type / Pre-human host: Ebolavirus / Wild animals <br>
        <p>
          Ebola ravaged West Africa between 2014 and 2016, with 28,600 reported cases and 11,325 deaths. 
          Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.
          Since then, the virus has been infecting people from time to time, leading to outbreaks in several African
          countries.
        </p>

        <h2>MERS(2012-present)</h2>
        Death Toll: 850 <br>
        Cause: HIV/AIDS <br>
        <p>
          Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is an illness caused by a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus)
          called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Most MERS patients developed severe
          respiratory illness
          with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. About 3 or 4 out of every 10 patients reported with
          MERS
          have died.
